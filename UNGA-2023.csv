Country,Statement
New Zealand,"Mr. President, [and Secretary-General if present], New Zealand welcomes the convening of this General Assembly Emergency Special Session. We regret the UN Security Council has been unable to perform its responsibility to act on behalf of all Member States. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us all as members of the General Assembly to exercise our collective political responsibility under the UN Charter to address matters of international peace and security. President, even as this meeting convenes, the conflict in Israel and Palestine escalates, the humanitarian crisis worsens, and civilian lives continue to be needlessly lost. It is intolerable to see civilians, many of whom are children and infants, continue to suffer disproportionately as innocent victims of this conflict. As I said in the Security Council two days ago, New Zealand condemns absolutely Hamas¡¯ terrorist attacks on Israel. We are appalled by their brutality, their targeting of civilians, and the taking of hostages. These are clear violations of international law. We call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. We support Israel¡¯s right to defend itself, in full compliance with international law, including in respect of actions taken in Gaza. Ultimately, no military solution will bring about a just and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians. The protection of civilians and delivery of humanitarian assistance is the most urgent priority. New Zealand joins calls for a humanitarian pause and humanitarian corridors to enable unhindered and sustained assistance and protection, in line with humanitarian principles, to those who desperately need it. We recognise the bravery of humanitarian workers who are working tirelessly in extraordinarily difficult circumstances to provide much needed assistance. We are deeply saddened that so many have been killed in the line of duty since the despicable events of 7 October. When New Zealand last served on the UN Security Council in 2015-16, we championed Resolution 2286, which demands greater protection for healthcare in armed conflict, including hospitals and medical personnel. Healthcare facilities must never be used for military purposes or be the object of attack. We are deeply concerned to see hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons. Their safety and security must be protected. We call for the establishment of designated safe areas that are strictly off limits as targets, or for military use. We expect Israel and Hamas to act in accordance with international humanitarian law, which imposes obligations upon all parties engaged in armed conflict. The Palestinian people must not suffer for the atrocities of Hamas, even as Hamas exploits those same civilians as human shields. Israel also has an obligation under international humanitarian law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention, to provide basic needs for civilians in Gaza including food, water, energy, and shelter, and to facilitate humanitarian aid. New Zealand urges all parties, including Israel and Egypt, to continue to facilitate access for the delivery of urgent humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza. As the Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator has observed, seeing more aid and supplies entering Gaza is ¡°another glimmer of hope for the millions of people in dire need of humanitarian aid¡±. At the same time, ¡°they need more, much more¡±. For our part, New Zealand is supporting humanitarian appeals for populations in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel. We stand ready to increase our support in the coming weeks. This is not a time for political posturing or for using this conflict to advance any cause except bringing peace and security to Israel, Gaza, and the wider region. It is a time for de-escalation. Finally, New Zealand remains committed to a two-state solution, which envisions an independent State of Palestine living in peace and security alongside the State of Israel. A new political horizon is essential. We call on the international community to take urgent action to advance the Middle East Peace Process. Without it, the armed conflict may eventually cease, but there will be no winners: we will never be free of the violence, the loss of innocent lives, the antisemitism, and the Islamophobia that has erupted in Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and around the world since 7 October. As the Secretary-General has said, ¡°We cannot lose sight of the only realistic foundation for a true peace and stability: a two-State solution.¡± Thank you."
Cambodia,"Mr. President of the General Assembly,
Distinguished Delegates,
1. It is my honor to address this meeting in the name of a country -
Cambodia that not so long ago was consumed by decades of wars, the
killing field where those ¡°labeled¡± as the oppressed and oppressors were
devoured by the intense flame of hatred, vengeance, and extremism that
fed the most heinous crimes against humanity.
2. My delegation mourns the loss of so many innocent human lives,
including one Cambodian since October 7 until now, and also earlier,
both in the state of Israel and the state Palestine. The Palestine-Israel
conflict is a very complex and delicate issue. Therefore, Cambodia wishes to
make its own principled position in this regard, instead of joining the
statement made in the name any group.
3. Cambodia condemns all acts of terrorism and violence against innocent
civilians, regardless of their race, culture or religion. We are deeply
concerned by the escalation of violence, continued suffering and loss of
innocent human lives-women, children, babies and the elderly on the
lands of the present conflict.
4. Hatred and vengeance feed another cycle of hatred and vengeance. A war
cannot end a war and bring lasting peace and harmonious co-existence.
My delegation can feel the fire of anger, the pain and agony of all; and we
can only appeal and hope for the sense of moderation to prevail. Now
more than ever, it is of paramount importance to address the root causes
of the Palestine-Israel conflict, to enable both the peoples of Israel and
Palestine to co-exist side by side in harmony.
5. Mr. President, allow me to reiterate three points which I raised during
the recent open debate of the Security Council: First, it is heartbroken to see the increasing number of civilian
casualties and the pain they endure. My delegation urges all parties
to exercise utmost restraint, abide by the international humanitarian
law and constructively engaged in dialogues to de-escalate the
deteriorating situation and achieve a ceasefire or humanitarian
pause. We must make utmost effort to avoid the widening of the
war, and fully appreciate the concerns and legitimate aspiration of
all equally, so as to end the cycle of violence.
? Second, civilian lives and safety must be protected from harm in
conflicts. My delegation urges for the release of all civilian taken
hostage. We call on all sides not to target civilians and civilian
infrastructure and to allow unimpeded humanitarian access for the
delivery of essential aid such as food, water and medicines to those
in need, in accordance with international humanitarian law.
? Third, we call the international community to unite in a spirit of
genuine solidarity and sincerity, to foster a meaningful dialogue
and negotiations leading to a just and lasting peace.
6. Please, stop finger pointing, please give peace a chance, please allow love
for humanity to prevail for all the people on earth, regardless of their race
and faith. Please, empower the forces of moderation, to allow the people
Israel and Palestine to live side-by-side in lasting peace, security and
harmony.
7. Again, my delegation salutes the dedication and sacrifice of the UN staff
and those of humanitarian agencies who brave formidable risks and
danger to provide relief to the innocent civilians.
Thank you!"
Ireland,"President,
At the outset, allow me to thank you for convening this
crucial debate under the resumed 10th Emergency Special
Session of the General Assembly.
I also express my thanks to the Secretary-General and
commend his leadership and personal commitment to the
protection of civilians, access of vital humanitarian aid to
Gaza, and the resolution of the conflict.
President,
Ireland unreservedly condemns the heinous and barbaric
acts by Hamas on 7 October. The deliberate taking of
hostages, including children and the elderly, is simply
unconscionable. We call for the immediate and
unconditional release of all hostages. In the face of such appalling attacks, Israel has the right to
defend itself, but must comply with international law, in
particular international humanitarian law.
We stress the applicability of international humanitarian law
to all armed conflict. This includes the prohibition on the
targeting of civilians, the prohibitions on indiscriminate and
disproportionate attacks, the prohibition on collective
punishment, and the prohibitions on the taking of hostages
and the use of ¡°human shields¡±. These are obligations that
bind all parties to armed conflict: state and non-state actors
alike.
Earlier this week, we heard yet another deeply concerning
briefing from Special Coordinator Wennesland on the
situation on the ground. We are also highly troubled about
the impact of recent events on regional stability and call on
all regional and international actors to act responsibly.
President,
We are gravely concerned about the situation in Gaza and the
particular impact of the conflict on children. We renew our
call on Israel to end the blockade of Gaza and to allow
meaningful humanitarian access, especially of fuel, to enable
hospitals and relief organisations to function. Civilians in Gaza must have access to basic necessities: water,
medicine, food and fuel. There must be rapid, safe and
unhindered humanitarian access for the benefit of civilians in
the Gaza Strip.
Ireland again echoes the Secretary-General¡¯s call for a
humanitarian ceasefire or a humanitarian pause, to ensure
that the humanitarian needs of the population can be
comprehensively met.
We offer our deepest condolences to the families of the
UNRWA staff who have lost their lives during this conflict and
commend UNRWA and all other UN and humanitarian
personnel on the ground for their selfless work in support of
the people of Gaza and across the Middle East.
In response to the unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe
unfolding in the Gaza Strip, Ireland announced an immediate
package of ¢æ13 million last week - ¢æ10 million for UNRWA and
¢æ3 million for UN OCHA¡¯s Palestine Humanitarian Fund. We
urge other partners to also step up and support.
We are also highly concerned at the serious increase in
violence in the West Bank, including further forced
displacement of Palestinian communities. President, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the
Middle East may seem further away than ever. However, we
must all work towards this end.
Lasting peace can only be based on an enduring commitment
to mutual recognition, freedom from violence, incitement,
and terror, and the two-State solution. We re-affirm our
support for these principles.
Ireland¡¯s position on how to achieve this is longstanding and
based on respect for international law and the agreed
international parameters.
The two-State solution, ending the occupation, that meets
Israeli and Palestinian security needs and Palestinian
aspirations for statehood and sovereignty, based on the 1967
borders, and with Jerusalem as the capital of both states,
offers the only prospect for sustainable peace.
Ireland has consistently opposed all uses of the veto and will
continue to do so. We welcome these General Assembly
Debates as a means of calling the Permanent Members to
account when they prevent the Council from taking action in
defence of international peace and security.
Thank you, President."
Singapore,"Mr President,
1 Singapore welcomes the convening of this Emergency Special Session of
the General Assembly. We are disappointed that the Security Council, which had
met on several occasions to discuss this issue, was not able to agree on a prompt
and united response.
Mr President,
2 At the outset, I wish to express Singapore¡¯s utmost support for the efforts
of the UN Secretary-General to sustain the flow of humanitarian assistance to the
civilians affected by this terrible tragedy in Gaza. We commend the SecretaryGeneral for his leadership role in facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance
and recognize the important contributions made by UN agencies and other
humanitarian organisations on the ground. We support all efforts to defuse
tensions in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict.
Mr President,
3 Respect for the UN Charter and for international law has always been a
fundamental guiding principle of Singapore¡¯s foreign policy. The UN Charter and
international law provide the foundation for international peace and security.
4 On the 7th of October, Hamas carried out a major coordinated terrorist
attack on Israel - deliberately targeting civilians, murdering and kidnapping them
and perpetrating abhorrent acts of terror. We mourn the loss and suffering of so
many innocent civilians, including children and the elderly. This attack cannot
be condoned or justified by any rationale. We condemn this terrorist attack in the
strongest possible terms. We also call for the immediate and safe release of all
hostages taken by Hamas. 5 In this regard, it is worth recalling that just in June this year, the General
Assembly adopted a resolution on the Global Counter Terrorism Strategy. This
calls for the international community to reiterate its ¡°strong and unequivocal
condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by
whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes¡±1
.
Mr President,
6 Under international law, Israel has the legitimate right to defend its citizens
and its territory. However, Israel also has an obligation to comply with
international humanitarian law. All parties must abide by international
humanitarian law and do their utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians.
We welcome all efforts to establish and uphold safe zones and routes that will
keep civilians out of harm¡¯s way and allow for the delivery of humanitarian
assistance.
7 Singapore is deeply saddened by the dire humanitarian situation in the
Gaza Strip and the loss of so many civilian lives. This is a massive humanitarian
crisis. We urge all parties involved to allow the rapid, safe and unhindered
delivery of humanitarian aid and essential services to the civilian population in
the Gaza Strip. The Singapore Government has made a financial contribution to
support humanitarian relief operations through the Singapore Red Cross. Many
Singaporeans have also made their own contribution to the relief operations and
it is our hope that their contributions will reach those in need quickly.
Mr President,
8 The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a longstanding one, and it must be
resolved in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council
resolutions. This is the only way to stop the repeated cycles of violence.
9 Singapore¡¯s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been consistent.
We continue to hold the view that the only viable path to a durable, just, and
comprehensive solution is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the
relevant UN Security Council resolutions. We support the right of the Palestinian
people to a homeland, and Israel¡¯s right to live within secure borders. Both
Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, security, and dignity. We call on leaders from both sides to show leadership, to exercise restraint and to take the
difficult but necessary steps towards the vision of a two-state solution.
10 Thank you. "
EU,"Mr President,
The Candidate Countries North Macedonia?
, Montenegro?
, Albania?
, Ukraine, the Republic of
Moldova, as well as Andorra, Monaco and San Marino align themselves with this statement.
Thank you for giving me the floor and for convening this Emergency Special Session, as the
situation is deeply alarming and risks spiralling out of control throughout the region. And I want
to take the opportunity to thank the UN and all its personnel for their relentless work on the
ground, often at the risk of their lives, as well as the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General to
deescalate the conflict.
We regret that the use of vetoes has prevented the Security Council's efforts from addressing the
situation and from fulfilling its mandate and responsibility. This dramatic conflict and
humanitarian situation would have required a united, timely and strong message by the Council,
which the latter failed to deliver. This is deeply regrettable. We know that efforts are still
underway to have a product at the Council, and we encourage Council members to find a
common position.
The EU¡¯s position is well known. The European Union reiterates its condemnation in the strongest
possible terms of Hamas for its brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks across Israel. The use
of civilians as human shields by Hamas is a particularly deplorable atrocity.
The EU strongly emphasises Israel¡¯s right to defend itself in line with
international law and international humanitarian law. It reiterates its call on Hamas to
immediately release all hostages without any precondition.
The EU reiterates the importance of ensuring the protection of all civilians at
all times in line with international humanitarian law. It deplores all loss of civilian life.
The EU expresses its gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian
situation in Gaza and calls for continued, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and
aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors
and pauses for humanitarian needs. The European Union will work closely with partners in
the region to protect civilians, provide assistance and facilitate access to food, water, medical
care, fuel and shelter, ensuring that such assistance is not abused by terrorist organisations.
The EU recalls the need to avoid regional escalation and to engage with
partners in this respect including with the Palestinian Authority.
The EU is ready to contribute to reviving a political process on the basis of the
two-state solution, including through the Peace Day Effort, and welcomes diplomatic peace
and security initiatives and supports the holding of an international peace conference soon.
The EU stresses the need to fight dissemination of disinformation and illegal
content, and highlights the legal responsibility of platforms in this context.
We understand the rationale to have a resolution at the UNGA, in the absence of one at the
Security Council. We engaged constructively and have proposed amendments.
The above priorities in addition to the points we made over the last weeks will guide our approach
to the draft resolution put forward.
The purpose of the UN is to overcome divisions."
Malta,"President, Excellencies We have convened here today as we collectively grieve for the thousands of Israeli and Palestinian civilians who have lost their lives since 7 October. This is one of the darkest and most volatile periods the Middle East has seen in recent years. Hamas¡¯ heinous and terrorist crimes on 7 October as well as the indiscriminate rocket fire on civilians in Israel, which we condemn in the strongest possible terms, will resonate for generations, manifested as trauma, anguish, anger, and heartbreak. Many Israelis are still living the nightmare of knowing that their loved ones continue to suffer. Terror has no justification, and we must be clear in rejecting it. Hamas must immediately and unconditionally release all hostages. Israel has the right to self-defence, in line with international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, necessity, and proportionality. On the other side of Gaza¡¯s walls, it is not only hostages who are suffering. Millions of Palestinian civilians are under siege, with extremely limited access to water, food, fuel, electricity, medicine, or shelter, if any.  In conformity with international law, all parties are obliged to ensure that civilians are protected. We must urgently and genuinely address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Malta continues to strongly call for the establishment of a humanitarian ceasefire and humanitarian corridors. People must be allowed to bury their dead. Hospitals need fuel and anaesthesia. Over two million people require sustenance. Sustained provision of life-saving services is paramount.
The protection of humanitarian facilities, such as hospitals and designated safe zones, and the unimpeded access for humanitarian and UN personnel, including aid convoys is also critical. We are devastated to learn that 35 UNRWA humanitarians have lost their lives in Gaza. We commend the Agency for its heroic work these past weeks. As diplomats, we urgently need to do our job, to allow them the ability to keep doing theirs.
Malta welcomes current efforts towards allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza through Rafah and commends all partners involved. However, we note the current volume of aid is limited and needs to be adequately scaled-up.
This crisis is also having a devastating impact on women and children. [Some 50,000 women in Gaza are currently pregnant. More than 3,000 children have lost their fathers.] Ensuring that humanitarian supplies are gender responsive, and that women are involved in distribution, is essential for meeting the needs of women and girls, who are at higher risk of genderbased violence and psychological trauma.  President
The conflict has reawakened tangible risks of regional fissures and increased further uncertainty in an already turbulent world.
We must collectively unite to mitigate any risks or miscalculations which may lead this conflict to spill-over into the West Bank, or into the broader Middle East region. We call for all parties to exercise restraint, de-escalate, and respect the norms of international law.
In view of such urgent necessities and risks, Malta is now closely working together with the Elected Members of the Security Council on a text that we hope can garner consensus, and address the situation on the ground.
Palestinians have for far too long dreamt of a reality which embraces their legitimate aspirations, which isn¡¯t choked by decades of occupation, violence, and displacement. A reality which ensures the dignity of their children.
Israelis too deserve to live in peace and security, without being held hostage by terror.
To this end, Malta remains committed to a lasting and sustainable peace in the Middle East. A peace which is based on a two-State solution along the pre-1967 borders, addressing the legitimate aspirations of both sides, with Jerusalem as the future Capital of two States, living side-by-side in peace and security, in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions and internationally agreed parameters.  Peace is not optional and demands to be steered by a recognition of our common humanity.
I thank you. "
Iceland,"Mr. President, We are convening this Emergency Special Session meeting against the backdrop of another great tragedy for millions of Israelis and Palestinians and a disappointing impasse in the Security Council. Iceland supported the amendment proposed by Canada, which would have added a much-needed context and balance to the resolution. Iceland regrets that the amendment did not pass. Without the inclusion of those essential elements, Iceland decided to abstain on the resolution tabled by Jordan despite supporting many of its key elements, notably on the humanitarian front. It is unfortunate that consensus could not be reached on a resolution to address the grave humanitarian situation and the need for concrete action to protect civilians and facilitate the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance. Mr. President, Iceland joins the calls for humanitarian pause to facilitate the safe delivery of humanitarian aid throughout Gaza. Safe and unimpeded humanitarian access must be ensured. Civilians and civilian objects, medical personnel and humanitarian workers and assets must be protected. We deplore the immense suffering of innocent civilians and the thousands, including women, children and UN personnel, that have been killed. We are alarmed by the impact of mass evacuations of civilians in Gaza. We must prevent further escalation, for the sake of Israelis, Palestinians, and the
wider region. Across the world, this continuous violence is fuming the flames of hate,
Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and racism.
Mr. President,
Iceland is grateful to the UN Secretary-General for his tireless efforts to ensure the
urgent delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance to the civilian population of
Gaza. We echo his calls for humanitarian aid to the civilian population of Gaza so
desperately in need of food, water, shelter, and medical care.
We welcome the opening of the Rafah crossing and we commend the humanitarian
personnel working night and day to facilitate the urgent delivery of humanitarian
assistance. More aid is needed, and it is needed now. Time is running out.
Iceland has responded to UN emergency appeals with an additional contribution to
UNRWA, our long-standing humanitarian partner and the lead UN agency mandated
with supporting Palestine refugees. We urge other donors to step up their support to
UNRWA¡¯s critical front-line delivery of aid to the people of Gaza.
Mr. President,
We must break out of this vicious cycle of violence and work towards a sustainable
political solution. The international parameters for a long-term, sustainable solution
to the conflict are clear: A two-state solution, based on international law, with Israel
and Palestine living side by side in peace and security, and mutual recognition.
Even in the midst of crisis, we must not give in to violence and hate. We must not
lose hope even when peace seems unrealistic and distant. We must put the peace
process back on track. Otherwise, we run the risk of perpetuating the cycle of
violence and humanitarian conditions deteriorating even further ? to the detriment of
everyone.
Thank you."
Poland,"Mr. President, Multilateralism has always been the foundation of Poland's activity at the UN, and our actions have been guided by the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations. Therefore, we fully support all international efforts aimed at restoring peace. Poland follows with great concern the current devastating crisis in the Middle East. We know very well the consequences of war, invasion and terror, which are felt for generations. Now, in this critical time we should make every effort to reach the cessation of hostilities and to return to a diplomatic path of this dispute. Mr. President, Poland decided to abstain on this resolution, as we believe that the path to peace requires including several key elements missing in the text. First, the submitted proposal lacks a clear condemnation of the Hamas attack of October 7 this year. Terrorism aiming at the civilian population cannot be tolerated under any circumstances, and that is why Poland condemned the brutal attacks on civilians carried out by Hamas on its very onset. Second, it should be stated clearly that Israel ? just as any other state - has the right to defend itself and its citizens in compliance with the international law and international humanitarian law. Third and lastly, we are also joining all those calling for immediate and unconditional release of all hostages taken by Hamas. Among them there is one Polish citizen, a distinguished historian working for Yad Vashem. We expect Mr. Alex Dancyg to return home safe and sound. Nevertheless, we largely agree with the humanitarian provisions of the presented resolution. For decades, Poland has been involved in humanitarian and development aid projects in the Middle East, with particular focus on Palestine and Lebanon. Poland¡¯s yearly contributions to UNRWA, which we have decided to supplement with fresh USD 250 thousand, are a clear proof of our wider political commitment to the stabilization of the Middle East.In this context, we were satisfied to see the opening of the Rafah crossing last week, and the first convoys of aid trucks entering Gaza. However, the flow of
humanitarian aid into the Strip must continue and rise.
We strongly believe that the lives of civilians, on both sides, must be protected
in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law. The
nearly complete blockade of the Gaza Strip, which hinders the imports of food,
water, medicine, and electricity, must end immediately. The strategy of
collective punishment that puts civilians at risk is a wrong one.
We should make every effort to reach the cessation of hostilities and to return
to a diplomatic path of this dispute. We fully believe that within the UN we ? as
international community ? should be able to develop a common position on this
extremely important issue. Otherwise, escalation and spreading of the conflict
may have devastating and long-lasting consequences.
In this vein, Poland remains open to constructive cooperation and committed to
a negotiated and viable two-state solution built upon the internationally agreed
parameters.
I thank you."
Bulgaria,"Mr. President,
Bulgaria is gravely concerned with the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and calls
for continued, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through
all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs.
We underline the importance of ensuring the protection of all civilians at all times in line with
international humanitarian law and deplore all loss of civilian life.
However, we must also recognize that the heinous and indiscriminate terrorist attacks of Hamas
across Israel, which we condemn in the strongest terms, brought unimaginable suffering of civilians.
The use of civilians as human shields by Hamas is a deplorable atrocity. We call for the immediate
and unconditional release of all hostages.
There is no justification for terror and Israel has the inherent right to defend itself in accordance with
international law and international humanitarian law.
Unfortunately, the resolution that was just adopted falls short of recognizing that and for those reasons
Bulgaria abstained on it.
The priority now is to prevent further escalation of the conflict. The international community should
invest more efforts in creating a real political horizon for a solution through intensive outreach and
clear messages.
We remain committed to a lasting and sustainable peace based on ¬Ñ two-state solution and the relevant
resolutions of the UN Security Council. It must be made clear that there cannot be a military solution
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The only way towards a just and sustainable peace is returning to
the Peace Process and taking it forward."
Portugal,"Thank you Mr. President,
[We align ourselves with the EU statement, and we would like to add the following
remarks in our national capacity.]
Mr. President,
Let me again reaffirm Portugal¢¥s unequivocal condemnation of the terrorist attacks by
Hamas, solidarity with Israel, and recognition of Israel¡¯s duty to its citizens to eliminate
the threat posed to them by Hamas lethal capabilities. Terrorism in all its forms should
be condemned and I will be very clear, hostages must be released immediately and
without preconditions. No matter the savagery of the worst terrorist attack of its history, Israel¢¥s actions must
respect International Humanitarian Law. No party to an armed conflict is above
international humanitarian law. Tragically, civilian population, hospitals, UN facilities,
including schools, and other critical and civilian infrastructures, are not being protected.
We are witnessing, beyond doubt, clear violations of International Humanitarian Law
in Gaza.
The death toll on both sides is staggering. We cannot remain indifferent to the
suffering of innocent victims, Israelis, Palestinians, and other nationalities, including
UN workers. At this moment our collective priority should be the protection of
civilians and addressing the tragic humanitarian situation on the ground.
Portugal fully supports SG Ant?nio Guterres call for a humanitarian cease fire. A large
humanitarian aid effort is needed now. Limited access will not prevent further loss of
life nor will ease the epic suffering of the civilian population in Gaza, and the current
volume of aid entering in Gaza is widely considered insufficient.
We commend the SG tireless advocacy for aid to reach the population of Gaza and
the UN work on the ground and pay our respects to those who died in the service of
UNRWA.
Mr. President,
It is also crucial to avoid the spread of the conflict. To the West Bank and beyond, by
accident or calculated action. We welcome and encourage the continuation of regional
and international efforts, both in multilateral and bilateral spheres to prevent a
spillover. We must return to the diplomatic track. Recognising the underlying problems and the
nature of the issues at stake, as rightly done by the UNSG Guterres to the Security
Council last Tuesday. This is the only way to break this cycle of violence and
extremism. As stated by Portugal at that Security Council meeting, the high
expectations created by the Oslo Accords three decades ago remain unfulfilled and
the non-violent political path has yet to be rewarded. We all must work to that end, at
the forefront those directly concerned such as neighbouring countries.
We must transform this crisis into a moment of hope and opportunity both for Israelis
and Palestinians and do our utmost in preventing that anger and confrontation
prevails. Once the guns fall silent, we cannot just go back to the status quo ex ante. It
is our collective responsibility to address the structural drivers of this conflict. This
will require a renewed involvement of all relevant actors and a determined effort to
implement the UNSC resolutions on the matter and set a clear and solid path to a
Palestinian State fulfilling the Two State Solution.
Despite the efforts made, which we recognize, the adopted UNGA resolution fails to
condemn the appalling terrorist attacks of October 7th by Hamas and the taking of
hostages. We deeply regret this. Acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable
regardless of their motivations, whenever and by whomever committed. Hostage taking
constitutes a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime under
International Criminal Law. That is why we voted in favor of the Canadian amendment.
In the aftermath of Hamas¢¥s horrific attack, a massacre that evokes some of the darkest
memories of persecution against the Jewish people, we shared in the grief of families and rightly declared solidarity with the Israeli people. The same humanity and belief in
the inherent value of every human life makes it impossible to ignore the Palestinian
suffering and the catastrophic reality today in Gaza. This human tragedy unfolding
before our eyes must be stopped now. No matter what, a humanitarian truce must be
established immediately. That is why Portugal voted in favor."
Somalia,"Mr. President,
I express my deep appreciation for the prompt and timely reconvening of the General
Assembly¡¯s tenth emergency special session on the Question of Palestine, a time yet another
tragically marked in the long history of the Palestinian people, who continue to be under
occupation. We align ourselves with the statements delivered on behalf of the Arab Group
and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation by Jordan and Mauritania respectively. The
ongoing conflict has resulted in countless lives being lost and a humanitarian crisis that can
no longer be ignored.
At the outset, I would like to begin by expressing my heartfelt condolences to the
Palestinian people and Government over the loss of thousands of innocent civilian lives,
including women and children of Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, and offer my wishes for the
speedy recovery of the injured ones. I pray Almighty God to bestow his strength and
resilience on the people of Palestine.
The protection of civilians is a fundamental principle of international law and a moral
imperative that should guide our actions. Regardless of the political complexities and
historical context, we must prioritize the safety and well-being of innocent men, women,
and children caught in the crossfire of this protracted conflict. In the occupied Palestinian territories, civilians have endured years of violence,
displacement, and a constant state of fear under a ruthless occupation. They face daily
challenges that threaten their basic human rights like access to clean water, healthcare,
education, and a sense of security. The indiscriminate use of force by the occupying force,
including bombings, shelling, and missile attacks, has taken a devastating toll on innocent
lives.
It is incumbent upon the international community to act swiftly and decisively to ensure the
protection of civilians. First and foremost, it is crucial to establish safe zones and
humanitarian corridors to provide essential aid and assistance to those in need.
I commend the United Nations Relief and Works Agency¡¯s vital role in coordinating relief
efforts and emphasize the need for generous donors to provide UNRWA with sufficient,
predictable, and sustainable funding. Furthermore, we encourage the neighboring
countries, civil society, and the private sector to redouble their efforts in alleviating the
suffering of the Palestinians inside and outside the occupied territories.
Second, all parties involved must commit to an immediate unconditional cease fire and
adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law, which prohibits the
targeting of civilians, UN staff, journalists, civilian infrastructure, and safe zones.
Accountability for violations must be pursued through impartial investigations, and those
responsible for war crimes must be held accountable for their actions.
Third, diplomatic efforts need to be intensified to find a lasting and just solution to the
conflict. Dialogue, negotiations, and a commitment to a two-state solution are essential to
achieving a peaceful coexistence. The international community must actively revive these
efforts and encourage all parties to engage in meaningful dialogue with the aim of reaching
a comprehensive and lasting peace agreement.
Finally, education and raising awareness are also crucial components of addressing the
conflict. By raising awareness about the plight of the Palestinian people, we can counter
false narratives and foster empathy and understanding about their legitimate national
aspirations of self-determination.
Educating ourselves and future generations about the historical and political context of the
conflict can help break down stereotypes and prejudices while achieving a more balanced
and nuanced understanding of the situation.
In conclusion,
The protection of civilians is an urgent and pressing issue that demands our immediate
attention. We must advocate for the respect of international law, establishing safe zones,
raising awareness about the plight of the Palestinians, and pursue diplomatic solutions to
end the conflict. I reiterate that the only viable option for the resolution of the longstanding conflict is the
end of the occupation and the full recognition of a free, sovereign, and independent State of
Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with relevant resolutions of the
Security Council and the General Assembly.
Somali Government and its people will continue to support and stand in solidarity with the
Palestinian people and Government in their unwavering pursuit of their legitimate rights,
including to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized borders."
Japan,"Mr. President,
Fifty years ago this month, the 1973 Arab-Israeli war began.
Thirty years ago, the Oslo Accords were signed. Twenty-six years
ago, the first meeting of the 10th Emergency Special Session of
this body was held. Who could have imagined we would still be
here today?
The horrifying series of events that began on 7 October continues
unabated, spiraling ever downwards with far too many losses.
Japan extends its sincere condolences to the families of the
victims.
Japan once again unequivocally condemns Hamas¡¯s brutal terror
attack on Israel, and its taking of hostages. The international
community should never tolerate such heinous acts. Every Member State has the right to defend itself and its people and such
right must be exercised in accordance with international law.
Just recently, Israel announced an expansion of its ground
operations in Gaza. The humanitarian situation in Gaza has never
been worse. It is catastrophic, and the Palestinian people are in
desperate need of food, water, fuel and medicine. We also extend
our sincere condolences to the families of the victims, and for the
loss of UN staff and personnel.
This meeting was convened because the Security Council has
repeatedly failed to take action. The Security Council, which has
the primary responsibility to maintain international peace and
security, should urgently and genuinely address the worsening
crisis, and prevent this conflict from spreading across the region.
As a current Council member, Japan is working tirelessly with
other Council members, in particular with the ten elected
members (E10) to craft a resolution acceptable to all. The world
cannot wait for the Council to finally fulfill its responsibility and
speak in a unified voice.
Several hostages have been released; more must follow
immediately as the families of more than 200 abducted victims
are waiting in despair for news that their loved ones are safe. We
demand the immediate and unconditional release of the remaining
hostages. Japan fully supports the immediate humanitarian pauses and the
establishment of humanitarian corridors to ensure that
humanitarian assistance can be provided. Full, rapid, safe and
unhindered humanitarian access consistent with international
humanitarian law must be allowed. While dozens of trucks have
passed through the Rafah crossing, hundreds more must follow to
meet the dire needs of over 2 million people.
We strongly hope for the early de-escalation of situation which
will be an important step for durable peace and stability in the
region.
In this vein, Japan has recently approved a $10 million USD aid
package as part of its response to the OCHA humanitarian flash
appeal. More is needed given the gravity of the situation in Gaza.
We call on all Member States and humanitarian partners to scale
up their assistance to meet these urgent needs.
Mr. President,
The international community needs to work together to restore
hope and pave a path for peace and security in both Palestine and
Israel.
Japan supports a two-state solution whereby Israel and a future
independent Palestinian state live side by side in peace and  security. All parties must make serious efforts to this end. For
now, we must all act to de-escalate the situation with a sense of
urgency.
I thank you."
Malaysia,"Thank you, Mr. President, for convening this important Meeting. Malaysia together with a group of countries supported the request by the Arab Group and the OIC for the resumption of this Meeting. 2. Malaysia aligns itself with the statement delivered by Mauritania on behalf of the OIC. 3. We express our deepest condolences to the bereaved families who are mourning the loss of their loved ones in the horrific ongoing hostilities. Mr. President, 4. The magnitude of atrocities inflicted upon the population of Gaza defies all rational comprehension and has shocked our human sensibilities to the core. For more than three weeks now, we have been witnessing indiscriminate bombings, the killing of civilians and the destruction of civilian objects and infrastructures. Sacrosanct principles of international law, including international human rights and humanitarian laws, continue to be violated. 5. There is absolutely no precaution, distinction or proportionality in Israel¡¯s actions.
6. More than 8,000 civilians have been killed, including more than 3,000 innocent
children. Around 70 percent of civilian fatalities in the ongoing act of collective
punishment by Israel on the Gazan population, are of women and children.
7. Water and electricity have been cut off, and the supply of fuel has been banned.
To say that Gaza is facing a humanitarian catastrophe is an understatement. It is
effectively, a death sentence on the entire population.
8. Under the Geneva Conventions, attacks on civilians, hospitals, places of worship
and other indispensable civilian infrastructure are unlawful and tantamount to war crimes.
9. Malaysia condemns the heinous and barbaric attacks on the civilian population of
Gaza, 40 percent of whom are children. All civilian lives regardless of race, religion and
nationality, must be protected.
10. We are also gravely concerned with the humanitarian calamity that continues to
unfold.
11. Malaysia joins others in demanding for an immediate ceasefire. This is absolutely
vital to stop further loss of life, and for necessary humanitarian work be carried out.
12. We call for the establishment of humanitarian corridors, as well as unhindered
and unfettered humanitarian access, so that aid can reach those in need throughout
Gaza, without any impediment.
13. The supply of electricity, water and fuel must be restored. These are all life-saving
essentials.14. Malaysia also condemns the black-out of communication services.
Communication services are a life-line. Communication infrastructure and the right to
communicate must always be protected.
15. 1.4 million, or 62 percent of Gaza population has been internally displaced.
Malaysia categorically rejects actions of forcibly displacing the population of Gaza. It
is a flagrant violation of international law. In fact, those who heeded the warning to
evacuate to the south continue to fall victim to indiscriminate bombings. Many have died.
No place is safe in Gaza at the moment.
16. The increasing settlers¡¯ violence in the West Bank, which has led, and is leading
to forcible transfer of Palestinians there, is also deeply concerning.
Mr. President,
17. We pay tribute to all humanitarian heroes who continue to serve in Gaza. We
salute their courage and commitment. Their safety and protection must be guaranteed.
18. In the last 24 hours, three more UNWRA staff have been killed, bringing the total
to 67, since the war began. We join others in mourning the 67 UNWRA staff. Malaysia
has been a regular contributor to UNWRA. Noting the extremely dire humanitarian
condition in Gaza at the moment, Malaysia has decided to allocate an additional
emergency contribution to UNWRA.
19. We appreciate the important role of the United Nations, under the leadership of the
Secretary General.
20. We also acknowledge the important roles played by countries in the region.
Malaysia is ready to collaborate with all international partners to address the humanitarian
needs of Gaza. Mr. President,
21. Malaysia shares the widespread disappointment towards the Security Council,
expressed by many Member States. The Security Council, the body entrusted with the
maintenance of global peace and security, continues to be paralysed, due to politicisation
based on narrow self-interests of some of its members. They continue to abuse their great
responsibility and privilege, turning the Council into an arena for one-upmanship and
blame game, instead of taking unified, swift and decisive action to stop the war and save
civilian lives. Their actions have exposed their hypocrisy, selectivity and double standard.
22. The General Assembly has stepped up, where the Security Council has failed. We
commend the 121 countries that had the courage to stand up for humanity and supported
the resolution proposed by Jordan, co-sponsored by 46 countries including Malaysia. The
adoption of the resolution is a sign that we in the United Nations, hear the resounding cry
of people around the world, demanding an immediate end to the massacre of innocent
lives in Gaza. The resolution is a breakthrough and carries great moral authority. It is the
important first step taken here at the United Nations, bringing back a glimmer of hope,
faith and trust in the multilateral process.
23. We call on the Security Council to respond to this General Assembly resolution, by
taking prompt, unified and decisive actions. Further inaction means continue being
complicit in the crimes against humanity committed by Israel in Gaza. Mr President,
24. According to UNICEF, Gaza has become a graveyard for children. More than 420
children are being killed or injured in Gaza every day.
25. How many more children have to be orphaned, killed or maimed? How many more
parents have to go through the ordeal of burying their innocent children? What more
does it take for some, to wake up, open their eyes to the truth, and stand up for humanity?
Be warned, history will judge.
26. More than half of the population of Gaza are children and youths. They deserve
hope for their future, not gloom and despair.
27. Killing people will not kill their ideals. Wherever there is occupation and oppression,
there is bound to be resistance.
28. As free nations, we must unite to end occupation, instead of perpetuating it. We
must support the right to self-determination, instead of denying it.
29. The only way to attain peace and security for everybody in the region is by ending
the illegal and oppressive occupation of Palestine. The vicious cycle of violence that its
many generations have been enduring, must end. Malaysia remains resolute in its
support for the self-determination of the Palestinian people through the establishment of
a free and independent state of Palestine, in accordance with the two-state solution,
based on pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Thank you"
Guyana,"Mr. President, The Government of Guyana supports the convening of this Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly in light of the deeply distressing levels of violence and hostility unfolding in the Middle East, particularly in the Gaza Strip, since 7th October. The targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure and the resulting casualties and injuries, the mass displacement of persons and the concomitant challenges of such movements, are worrying to say the least. The strike on the al-Ahli Hospital was nothing short of an illegal act of savagery that should never happen in any civilized society. The evacuation order to those in the Al-Quds Hospital must also be seen in the same way. Guyana expresses heartfelt condolences to those who lost loved ones in these tragic and undignified circumstances, and we pray for the speedy recovery of the injured. We also commiserate with the relatives and friends of UN staff members who were killed in the conflict. Mr. President, Twenty-four days ago, the world woke to the shocking news of an infiltration of Israeli territory by Hamas, rocket attacks on the country, and the killing and abduction of Israeli citizens. We condemn these events in the strongest possible terms and underscore that they were violations of international law. Since that attack, we have witnessed a military response by Israel
unprecedented in scale and impact, and one which has created a catastrophic
humanitarian crisis in the densely populated Gaza Strip. To compound the
problem, the Gaza Strip was under complete siege for the next thirteen days
following the attack. There was no way out and nothing could get in.
Electricity, water, fuel and food supplies were cut off. And 1.1 million people
were ordered to undertake a massive evacuation exercise from the north to
the south of the country. We are all aware of the abyss to which the people
of Gaza have been driven on account of these developments, even as war
continues.
Hapless civilians continue to bear the brunt of these attacks. We were
disheartened to hear the assessment that no place is safe in Gaza since
hospitals, schools and other buildings that should be safe spaces in
accordance with international humanitarian law were also struck in
indiscriminate strikes.
Guyana emphasizes the responsibility of parties to the conflict to fully and
unconditionally respect and uphold the principles of international law,
including international humanitarian law. Even wars have rules, and the
principles of distinction, proportionality, humanity, and necessity must be
upheld. The protection of civilians is paramount, and we call for an
immediate end to the indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian
infrastructure.
Page 4 of 7
Moreover, Guyana calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all
Israeli hostages, and for the immediate release of all Palestinian civilians
unjustly held. We demand their safety, well-being and humane treatment in
compliance with international law.
Mr. President,
The creation of a humanitarian corridor into Gaza is now an existential
question and Guyana was pleased to learn that the first aid convoy entered
Gaza on 21 October after thirteen days of a complete siege. But this is not
near enough. Before 7 October, at least 500 aid trucks entered Gaza daily.
Today, it is a fraction of that. We call on those with influence on the relevant
parties to exert all of it, so that there is unhindered and continued flow of life
saving aid to the people of Gaza. A comprehensive ceasefire is crucial to the
sustainability of the humanitarian intervention in Gaza. Guyana implores
the parties to immediately cease the fighting and to choose the path of
dialogue and peace.
We also underscore the importance of avoiding further escalations of the
violence to the West Bank and other parts of the region. We urge maximum
restraint by all parties to this end.
Mr. President, Excellencies
True and principled leadership can never involve overseeing the killing of
women and children. Shockingly, we have learnt that more than 3,500
Page 5 of 7
children have been killed in Gaza over these last 24 days - more than all those
killed in conflicts in the world annually since 2019. Children whose
childhood joys had already been curtailed, living in the constant shadow of
war and displacement. Children who, already versed in the sounds of war,
could tell when hellish artillery was approaching, and not only since October
7th. Children who nevertheless dreamt, perhaps believed, that this world,
this United Nations, would ensure that they and their families live in their
own country, in their own state, in peace and security.
But even as we mourn these little ones cut down before they could truly
experience what it means to live in peace, we see their surviving brothers
and sisters being denied food, water and other basic necessities. And the
hospitals to which the battered and maimed turn for a chance at life, are
denied fuel.
Mr. President, Excellencies,
The international community has failed these children and many before
them; it has failed the people of Palestine for more than 50 years.
Guyana underscores the special responsibility of the Security Council to act
in light of the threat that this situation poses to the maintenance of
international peace and security. The current paralysis of the Council on this
matter is therefore deeply concerning. We implore the Council to send a
strong and clear message to the people of Israel and Palestine, and the entire
region, that the rule of law will be upheld.
In this context, Guyana was encouraged that this General Assembly did not
falter on this situation when called upon to stand up for principles, justice
and the rule of law. We were among those who supported the resolution
adopted last Friday and we reiterate the provisions of that resolution. We
Page 6 of 7
call upon the concerned parties to adhere to those provisions as they are
morally obligated to do.
Mr. President,
Let me underscore the importance of the responsibility and involvement of
us all ? the international community - in finding a solution. In the words of
Guyanese poet Martin Carter:
¡°¡¦like a web is spun in pattern, all are involved, all are consumed.¡±
The United Nations has a moral obligation to the people of Palestine and
Israel to reinvigorate the peace process. It is the only way to guarantee the
exercise of the inalienable right to self-determination by the Palestinian
people and to address the security concerns of Israel. The Palestinian people
continue to be pushed further behind, with their aspirations for
development and peace strangled by cycle after cycle of violence and
oppression for over seven decades. The urgent realization of the two-state
solution based on the pre-1967 borders is critical.
The Government of Guyana is unwavering in its commitment to this
objective and is ready to contribute constructively to any genuine effort to
this end.

I thank you."
Namibia,"Mr. President,
1. Thank you for resuming the 10th Emergency Session of
the General Assembly under the ¡°Uniting for Peace:
Resolution¡±.
2. This session resumes in the context of a world that is
troubled, a world that looks to this August House, as an
international parliament of humanity to be bold and
decisive and bring hope in these dark times.
3. Allow me to draw on a life lesson that all of us have
learnt time and time again through each life phase:
There are two sides to every story.
4. With this conflict in mind, Namibia is quick to caution
that viewing a story from a different perspective should
not be seen as disregard for the pain of the other.
5. On 24 October 2023, during the Open Debate in the
Security Council, we witnessed an unwarranted attack
on the Secretary General when he stated that the attacks
of October 7 did not occur in a vacuum. They did not, as
this conflict predates this fateful day and the pain and
horror for both Palestine and Israel did not start on this
day.
6. Let me categorically clarify that as Namibia, we view the
current conflict through the prism of humanitarianism,
3
international law and human rights. It is this context
that we call for cessation of violence through a
ceasefire; an end to the mass displacement of
Palestinians and an end to the attempts to starve
Palestinians of humanitarian aid, including water and
fuel.
7. Last week, H.E Volke T?rk, High Commissioner for
Human Rights, stated that ¡° a binary view of the world
rooted in, you are either with me or against me is never
going to advance peace¡±. This is the message we have
for the Security Council which has failed to take action
in these dire times, these times where every minute that
is lost has direct impact on whether people live or die.
We urge Council Members to set aside their differences
and, in the letter and spirit of the principles and purposes
of the sacrosanct UN Charter, save a generation that is
on the verge of being wiped out, from the scourge of
war. History has taught us that war, wherever it
happens, is the absolute worst experience for all those
affected. The wounds of war do not heal.
8. The unabated killing, wanton destruction and callous
loss of lives must come to an end.
4
Mr President,
9. Namibia voted in support of the resolution presented by
Jordan because we are sensitised to the pain and
suffering of the Palestinian people. On Friday, this
August Assembly, showed that indeed, as what was said
by Martin Luther King Jr. ¡°The Moral arc of the universe
is long, but it bends towards justice.¡± With the utmost
compassion, I want to say to the Permanent Observer of
Palestine, we feel the pain and suffering of the
Palestinian People no less than we did when we walked
the corridors of the UN together as oppressed people.
We empathise with your protracted struggle for your
inalienable right to self-determination. Namibia is with
you in this journey, as it has always been. The injustices
meted out against you should be enough to condition us
to put up the guardrails of international law,
international humanitarian law and the compassion that
embodies the very notion of humanity as your protection
form further brutality. Namibia will continue to push
these frontiers in your name, using the systems,
processes and institutions at our disposal.
Mr President,
10.Last year, this Assembly adopted an important
resolution which requested the International Court of
5
Justice for an advisory opinion on the consequences of
the legality of the Israeli Occupation of the Palestinian
Territory, Including East Jerusalem.
11.While this consideration is sub-judice, the continued
escalation of violence especially over the last twelve
months reminds us that we have a responsibility to
reject the harmful rhetoric that dehumanises the
Palestinian People. Human animals do not exist.
Palestinian People like all members of the human family
are entitled to the inherent dignity and the equal and
inalienable rights that form the foundation of freedom,
justice and peace in the world. These are guaranteed by
the Universal Declaration of Human rights and we regard
them as fundamental and indivisible.
Mr President,
12.The resilience of the Palestinian People in the face of
collective punishment against an entire population,
despite the use of indiscriminate and disproportionate
force for decades should invoke in us a sense of duty. A
duty to bring an end to the grave escalation of violence
and show that indeed humanity and compassion are an
umbrella that unite us for the common cause of peace.
I thank you. "
Bangladesh,"Mr. President,
I thank you for convening the 10th Emergency Special Session of the UNGA.
Bangladesh aligns itself with the statement delivered by Mauritania, on behalf of the
OIC Group.
The People of Palestine has been going through unimaginable misery, inhumane
treatment and colonial subjugation due to continuous attack and killing, expansion
of illegal settlement, demolition of homes and forcible transfer by Israeli Occupying
Forces, for decades.
However, in the last 24 days, what is happening, has gone beyond description which
has crossed all boundaries of international norms and principles. Indiscriminate and
disproportionate bombardment on Gaza even on hospitals and refugee camps by
Israel has already killed more than 8000, around half being children, and around
20000 have been injured. The Number is increasing by every passing minute. More
than 1.5 million Palestinians have been displaced internally in an area of just 140
2
square miles and they do not have necessary life-saving assistance. They are running
out of food, water, electricity, shelter and medical assistance.
At this moment, immediate ceasefire is a must and I urge this august Assembly to
do the righteous thing to save hundreds of thousands of lives.
Mr. President,
It is regrettable that due to the failure of the Security Council to take action,
thousands of civilians have already been killed and the delay in ceasefire will kill,
injure and displace more innocent people. The situation is further deteriorating with
the ground invasion by Israel. We have seen in the past also; the inaction of the
Security Council and failure to implement its own resolutions had encouraged the
occupying Power to continue its aggressions and brutality that tantamount to war
crimes. We urge again to take immediate action to stop the war and take necessary
steps to implement all the resolutions of the United Nations related to Palestine.
Mr. President,
Blocking of humanitarian assistance is totally unacceptable and cannot be justified
in anyway. Blockade of fuel and electricity has brought hospitals to a standstill,
risking the lives of the thousands of wounded and the sick. Immediate humanitarian
access to Gaza with adequate life-saving assistance needs to be ensured. We
welcome the humanitarian aid through Rafah crossing but we all know the
meagerness of the supplies going into Gaza which is characterized by the SecretaryGeneral as a drop in the ocean. We call once again to ensure immediate, continuous,
3
sufficient and unhindered provision of essential supplies and services to civilians
throughout the Gaza Strip.
Mr. President,
We are deeply concerned at the killing of UN and other aid workers, health
personnel, and journalists in Gaza and we strongly condemn such heinous act. It is
unfortunate that 67 UNRWA staff and personnel have been killed and numerous
UNRWA installations have been damaged so far. We demand protection of the
United Nations facilities and all humanitarian installations.
We have been seeing bombing on hospitals and shelters with a deliberate attack to
kill the civilians. Are these not the incident of war crimes and genocide? It is not
acceptable collectively punishing a civilian population who has been struggling for
their independence for more than seven decades and any attack cannot be justified
in the name of ¡°Right to Self Defense¡±. As an occupying power, Israel¡¯s claim of
right to self defence and its endorsement by many, its nothing but a fallacy of
international law on the question of occupation and the rights and duties of
occupying power. Moreover, this august Assembly cannot discriminate among
people while taking decision. I echo the words of the Palestinian Ambassador in his
recent deliberation in the Security Council that ¡°Palestinian lives are not less
precious than the Israeli lives¡±. We also reject unequivocally Israel's call to forcibly
displace the Palestinians out of their own homeland - which is an attempt to further
deteriorate the humanitarian situation in the entire region.
4
Mr. President,
We need to hold Israel accountable for its war crimes and blatant disrespect for
international humanitarian law. We have clear legal definitions, in the
international law, of genocide, of war crimes, of crimes against humanity.
Failure to do so in the past, mainly due to the blatant double standard undertaken
by some governments and media alike, has brought this awful day and it is a
shame for all of us that after having so many resolutions even in the Security
Council with clear road map of the solution to this crisis, we have failed to
implement this.
Mr. President,
I would like to refer to the Secretary-General who said that the attack on 07 October
did not happen in vacuum. Decades-long occupation, and Israel¡¯s absolute impunity,
guaranteed by some member states, from consequences of committing atrocities, and
undermining all diplomatic and multilateral efforts to establish peace in the Middle
East towards the two-state solution, has all led to this point today. We do not want
any further loss of lives anywhere. In this regard, we would like to repeat that the
only solution to this crisis; the only way to establish peace in Palestine and the whole
region is establishment of an independent, viable, and sovereign Palestinian State,
with East Jerusalem as its capital, under a two-state solution based on the pre-1967
borders.
5
Mr. President,
Before concluding, I would like to remind you once again that the UN Charter starts
with our determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and
if we fail to do so we will remain accountable to our future generations. We must
not lose sight of the right of self-determination of the people of the Occupied
Palestinian Territories. However, at this time, this is more important than ever to
avoid any more killing, to ensure humanitarian assistance, to save the civilians and
humanitarian personnel. We call upon Israel to abide by the GA resolution adopted
last Friday, which we co-sponsored, and to stop all atrocities immediately by
agreeing to a ceasefire.
I thank you."
Laos,"Mr./Mme. President,
The international community stands at the precipice of a grave security crisis, teetering on the
brink of a major catastrophe. Immediate and unified actions are imperative to avert this impending
disaster.
Following the UN Security Council¡¯s inability to reach a consensus on a resolution for an
immediate ceasefire and the provision of urgent humanitarian assistance to save innocent lives in
Gaza, the responsibility now rests with the General Assembly to address this long-overdue yet
critically urgent issue, with the aim of halting the ongoing violent hostilities between Israel and
Palestine.
For over seven decades, political divisions have hindered progress on the Israel-Palestine issue.
Regrettably, these divisions have recently stalled any concrete action from this organization to
protect civilians in dire need of exercising their fundamental right to survival. As this humanitarian
tragedy unfolds, it is crucial for all United Nations members to set aside unilateral political interests
and unite unconditionally to save the innocent lives caught in the conflict. We urge all concerned
parties to exercise maximum restraint, halt all violent acts, and re-open humanitarian corridors.
Mr./Mme. President,
The Lao PDR has been closely monitoring the violent hostilities between Israel and Palestine with
deep concern, witnessing the devastating toll on lives and property. As a responsible UN member,
and in our commitment to contributing to peace in the Middle East, we therefore, have supported
efforts by the Arab Group, the OIC, and other UN member states to reconvene this Tenth
Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, as per GA Resolution 377 (V) of 1950.
(Check against delivery) 2
We commend the Secretary-General, all UN personnel, and non-governmental organizations who
continue to risk their lives working tirelessly in conflict areas, actively engaging with all parties to
deescalate violence and prevent further humanitarian crises.
The recent three weeks of violence underscore the urgent need for an immediate, comprehensive
ceasefire. Despite positive developments such as the release of (four) hostages and the initial
allowance of humanitarian supplies through the Rafah checkpoint, there is much more to be done.
This includes providing efficient and unconditional humanitarian assistance.
Mr./Mme. President,
Given the current circumstances, it is imperative that we pursue diplomatic solutions and promote
messages of peace:
First, recognizing that violence benefits no one is crucial. Military engagement only
exacerbates the crisis, making an immediate ¡°humanitarian ceasefire¡± vital and
underscoring the need for dialogue and negotiation.
Second, we must unequivocally condemn acts of violence and assaults on civilians. Both
Palestinian and Israeli populations deserve to live free from fear, with their security equally
safeguarded.
Third, strict adherence to international humanitarian law is essential. Life-saving
humanitarian aid ? food, water, medicine, fuel ? must be allowed to reach all civilians in
Gaza swiftly, safely and at scale. Ensuring the delivery of these life-saving supplies at the
scale needed for the people in Gaza, including UN, UNRWA and ICRC personnel and
individuals of all nationalities, is a top priority. Establishing unhindered humanitarian
corridors and the unconditional release of people held captive are critical steps.
Fourth, Countries with influence in the region must collaborate with all relevant parties to
prevent escalation and regional spillover.
And fifth, the ultimate resolution to the Palestinian issue lies in the implementation of the
two-state solution, enabling Palestine and Israel to coexist peacefully. Working towards a
comprehensive, just, and enduring settlement, guided by relevant UN resolutions and
international peace efforts, is fundamental.
Mr./Mme. President,
Our immediate obligation is to protect civilians, including during acts of self-defense and
in situations involving hostages, hospitals, and schools. We must discourage incitement, combat
dehumanization, and work tirelessly to protect the lives of Palestinians, Israelis, and victims from
other nations caught in this conflict. In conclusion, allow me to invoke the poignant words of late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin during the Oslo Accords signing ceremony in 1993: ""We are
destined to live together, on the same soil in the same land... Enough of blood and tears. Enough.""
These words serve as a timeless reminder of our shared humanity and the urgent need for peace.
I thank you."
Sierra Leone,"Mr. President,
1. I thank you for convening this meeting.
2. The present situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian
question, and the response of the UN Security Council in the past
weeks and even up to yesterday, is an indication that the United
Nations needs to be constructive, deliberate, and sincere in its
approach to its work and actions.
3. This must be the case of the Security Council, which has the UN
Charter primary responsibility for the maintenance of international
peace and security and must carrying out this function on behalf
of the member States. The world, therefore, is counting on the
United Nations more especially the Security Council to act, and it
must not renege in fulfilling this important mandate.
4. We acknowledge the role of the General Assembly in situations
where the Security Council has failed to act. In the open debate of
the Security Council on ¡°the situation in the Middle East, including
the Palestinian question¡±, we expressed our position on the
escalation of the prolonged conflict rooted in the occupation of
the State of Palestine by the State of Israel.
5. Sierra Leone continues to unequivocally condemn in the strongest
terms the undefendable heinous attack against Israeli civilians by
Hamas on 7th October 2023. Sierra Leone also equally condemns in
the strongest terms the taking of hostages by Hamas and calls for
their immediate and unconditional release.
6. Since the 7th October attacks, we have further noted with grave
concern the escalation of the violence, particularly the response
by Israel. In noting the existence of the right to self-defence in the
Charter of the United Nations, which is available to all States, we
3
are of the firm view that any response must be in line with
international law, in particular international humanitarian law,
human rights and other relevant legal norms.
7. We therefore unequivocally condemn attacks on civilians and
civilian objects, and in this regard, we also condemn in the
strongest terms the heinous attack on the Al Ahli Baptist Hospital in
the Gaza Strip, which is totally unacceptable. We support the calls
for an investigation into the matter. As we urge for timely
investigations, Sierra Leone calls on accountability mechanisms to
be fully engaged to preserve any evidence of violations of
international law to ensure accountability. Reports on the
investigation of the current escalation by the Office of the
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is therefore a
development we fully support.
8. We deeply sympathize with the families of the victims of the
regrettable recent escalation of violence and the ongoing
occupation. While we can only offer our deep sympathies, at this
stage, the United Nations and more especially the Security Council
can act and must act.
Mr. President,
9. As we welcome the diplomatic engagements that have led to the
flow of limited humanitarian aid into Gaza, Sierra Leone is gravely
concerned about the ever-deteriorating humanitarian situation
with the simultaneous escalation of the violence. The deteriorating
humanitarian situation and the inability of UNRWA to provide
adequate humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza, owing to
the indiscriminate bombardment which necessitates a
humanitarian ceasefire and the establishment of humanitarian
corridors for the delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians. The
humanitarian ceasefire must indeed ensure full, speedy, safe, and
4
unimpeded humanitarian access for United Nations humanitarian
agencies and implementing partners.
10. Sierra Leone joins the strong call for the provision of unrestricted
and adequate essential goods and services to civilians, including
electricity, water, fuel, food, and medical supplies. This is only in
compliance with international humanitarian law, to ensure the
survival of civilians.
Mr. President,
11. We note with concern the danger of a spillover of the current
crisis in the Middle East region. If consolidated action is not taken,
a spillover will compound the existing fragile situation in the region.
Regrettably, the region is marked by mass displacement, increased
coordinated activities by armed groups, an unimaginable
humanitarian crisis and insecurity and loss of civilian lives.
12. With this recent escalation, we are fully convinced that it is only
genuine dialogue and negotiations based on the ¡°two-state
solution¡± that will guarantee a lasting peace between Israel and
Palestine.
13. In closing, Sierra Leone hereby calls for concerted efforts to
explore diplomatic and political avenues geared towards finding a
peaceful, just, and lasting solution to this conflict.
14. I thank you."
Canada,"As this Emergency Session on the situation in Gaza and the Middle East region winds down, it¡¯s
important that we continue our collective diplomatic efforts, because, on the ground, the situation is
still very dire.
Last week, Canada introduced an amendment to the resolution in an effort to ensure the General
Assembly acknowledged that this situation arose following an unconscionable terrorist attacks by
Hamas on Israeli civilians on October 7th.
Canada is pleased that over half of the voting members of the Assembly felt the same way, but regrets
that its amendment did not pass, and therefore abstained on the resolution.
This doesn¡¯t change Canada¡¯s general diplomatic efforts here and in the region which are focused on
ensuring:
- That the hostages currently held by Hamas ? be they Canadian, Israeli, Thai, American, Argentinian,
Chinese or Russian - be released as soon as possible;
- that until hostilities stop between the parties, all possible steps be taken to limit the loss of life;
- that humanitarian services are increased immediately and substantially, and Israel, Egypt, the UN cooperate fully to ensure that vital humanitarian help is provided; (Canada has already allocated 60 million
dollars and is trying to get these funds put to work as quickly as possible);
- that, to ensure the above critical steps, assurances be given and measures taken by all parties to
guarantee the safe delivery and distribution of humanitarian assistance;
- that the over 400 Canadian nationals and permanent residents currently trapped in Gaza, be permitted
to leave;
We know that many efforts are underway to achieve these objectives, and are ready to engage in
whatever diplomatic and other efforts are needed to resolve them.
We heard the terrible descriptions in the Security Council yesterday from the leaders of UNRWA, UNICEF
and OCHA of the devastating toll this conflict is taking, and Canadians weep for the over 3,200 children
killed in Gaza in the last three weeks, just as we weep for the Israeli children lost on or since October 7th
.
We urge the steps required to deal with the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation. Rapid and
unimpeded access to assistance is essential, which is why we endorse the need for humanitarian pauses.
We also need to keep our eyes on longer term discussions around a sustainable political solution to this
conflict.
That is what needs to change. How to do it is diplomacy¡¯s necessary task. Talk of the ¡°two state
solution¡± is empty unless accompanied by the end of the violent rhetoric of absolutism, violent acts of
terror, and a simple refusal to accept the legitimate interests of all parties.
There is no point in drafting agreements and constitutions in the air. The security interests of everyone
must be respected, peace will only come with a willingness to compromise, and that will only happen
once all parties understand the deep risks and terrible costs of the current confrontation.
Passing, or not passing, resolutions is what this Assembly does. But achieving the reality of a two-state
solution, two states whose borders and boundaries would be both mutually and internationally
recognized, whose peoples can live in peace, respect and security, means that deep, and practical steps
must be taken to resolve the issues in dispute. "
Nepal,"Mr. President,
Nepal is grieving under deep anguish in the death of 10 Nepali nationals in southern
Israel when it came under sudden attack on 7 October 2023.
The Government of Nepal has strongly condemned the terrorist attack on Israel.
With equal gravity, we are against the indiscriminate use of force against civilians
by both parties involved in the conflict, including the strike at the hospital in Gaza
that killed hundreds of people including children, women, elderly, medical
personnel, and patients.
We are deeply disturbed by the rising number of deaths of civilians, destruction of
properties, and the resulting humanitarian crisis.
Nothing can justify inflicting sufferings on and killings of innocent people, whether
Palestinians or Israelis.
Nepal calls for an immediate de-escalation and avoidance of indiscriminate use of
force to prevent civilian casualties, stop the destruction of public and private
properties, and provide immediate, unrestricted and adequate humanitarian
assistance to the desperate civilians in Gaza.
The United Nations has the responsibility to prevent humanitarian catastrophe and
breach of peace. We, the member states must demonstrate courage to utilize the
platform of the United Nations to bring both sides to the negotiating table to find a
just, peaceful, amicable, and lasting political solution to the problem.
To this end, Nepal supports the efforts made by the Secretary-General to de-escalate
war, open humanitarian corridors, and avail unrestricted humanitarian relief.
We are deeply concerned about our missing student, Mr. Bipin Joshi, and are
desperately waiting for information on his whereabouts.
Nepal is in favor of a two-state solution with Israel and Palestine, living side by side
in peace and security, within recognized international borders based on international
law and the relevant UN resolutions. This is the only way forward for a just, lasting
and peaceful solution to the question of Israel -Palestine conflict.
2 | P a g e
Peace is only possible when both sides respect each other¡¯s existence and dignity.
Hatred never incubates peace.
Nepal calls upon both sides to exercise maximum restraint and resort to dialogue to
find a solution where both Israelis and Palestinians live in peace.
I thank you. "
Greece,"I align myself with the statement delivered previously by the EU and would like to add the
following in my national capacity.
Let me start by recognizing the courageous work and sacrifice of UN employees in Gaza, and in
particular, those ? including the 64 UNRWA staff ? who have paid the ultimate price in the line
of duty.
I would also like to extend our sincere condolences to all Palestinians and Israelis who have
suffered or lost loved ones.
Mr. President,
The gravity of the situation in the Middle East gives us great concern. This serious crisis presents
a huge challenge and a test to all of us.
In view of the above Greece welcomes the attempts of the Security Council to address the
situation in Israel and Gaza and regrets that these efforts so far have not been fruitful. We
acknowledge that discussions are still ongoing and we hope that a conclusion will be reached.
My country right from the start condemned in the strongest possible terms Hamas for its brutal
and indiscriminate terrorist attacks across Israel. Terrorism has no justification. Any form of
violence, terrorism, or inhumane treatment is totally unacceptable. Israel has a right to its selfdefense, to react and protect its citizens, always in line with international law and international
humanitarian law. We call for the immediate release of all hostages without any precondition.
Human lives cannot be reduced to a bargaining chip.
At the same time, we are particularly alarmed by the catastrophic humanitarian crisis unfolding
today in Gaza. All civilians must be protected at all times by all parties. To protect civilians and
provide life saving supplies all necessary measures should be taken, including humanitarian
corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs. Our aim should be to protect as many lives as
possible. In this regard, we are stepping up our assistance together with our partners to help
those in need.
Yet, we should all make sure that this conflict will not spill over and take far-reaching dimensions
in the Middle East. We call on all states and international organizations to intensify urgent
concrete steps to support efforts by the United Nations and regional states to prevent the
violence in Gaza from expanding to other areas in the region.
2
Greece¡¯ foreign policy is a principled one. We remain fully committed to a two state solution in
accordance with international law and relevant United Nations resolutions. Only a political
solution could create the long-term conditions for peace, stability and prosperity in the wider
region. "
Lesotho,"As I take the floor, allow me to join others in coveying our deepest condolences, and
words of sympathies, to all families who have lost their loved ones in both Israel and
Palestine, as a result of this unprecedented conflict of our times. We also pay tribute,
to the United Nations humanitarian personnel, who died in the line of duty, while
working selflessly to provide hope and support to the desparate civilians in Gaza.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the injured. We continuw to offer our solidarity to
those who are working tirelesly in their mediation efforts in order to find lasting
peace and stability in that region of the world, with the main objective of averting
further loss of innocent lives.
It would be remiss of me, not to commend the General Assembly, for taking a
principled and historical step last Friday, by prioritizing the humanitarian situation of
the People of Palestine through the adoption of the Resolution that recognises the
centrality of preservation of lives of innocent civillians. However, my delegation
remains mindful of the fact that, adoption of the said Resolution, does not, in any way
whatsoever, symbolize the end of the conflict in question. It only calls for further
engagement by all and sundry, to do our utmost, to find a lasting diplomatic and
political solution to this problem, which has acquired unpresidented proportions of
our life time.
Regretably, the repeated failure of the UN Security Council to pass a difinitive
resolution on this conflict erodes confidence of the global citizenry on the
functionality of this organization, thus, amplifying the glarion call for its reform. We
implore its members to take full responsibility and find an immidiate solution to this
war.
Mr President,
My delegation is deeply concerned about the violation of human rights of people on
both sides, some of which have been abducted, while others are being cut-off from
essential basic needs. Unfortunately, most of them are women and children who are
non-combatants. In this regard, we call for the immediate release of those kept in
captivity. The world cannot continue to watch the horrifying pictures of children in
Gaza being mercilessly killed on a daily basis from the Israeli bombardment. This
situation can only be tolerated by those without morality. Under these circumstances,
Lesotho appeals to all parties involved to exercise maximum restraint.
Mr President,
Further escalation of this conflict, raises legitimate concerns regarding its
potentiality to spiral out of proportion. We are therefore all bound, to call on all
parties, to give way to a diplomatic solution without any further delay. At the same
time, we urge all parties to allow humanitarian corridors with guarantees of safety to
humanitarian personnel.
In conclusion Chair, we express concern over any attempt to forcefully relocate the
people of Gaza contrary to the past UN resolutions, which unequivocally recognise
their inalienable right to self-determination. Our wish is that of two state solution
wherein both Israelis and Palestinians will live side by side in peace with each other
in line with the pre 1967 borders with East Jerusalem being the capital of Palestine.
History has proofed beyond reasonable doubt that the cost of war is insurmountable
in all its facets. As a result, therefore, during this critical time, the world must stand
up steadfastly to recall the very foundations of the United Nations and live up to
them.
Finally, as John Donne posits in his poem, ¡° No man is an Island entire of itself,
¡¦¡¦any man¡¯s death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind. And
therefore, never sent to know for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for thee.¡±
I thank you!!"
Romania,"Mr. President, We are here to discuss the very serious crisis in the Middle East and to address the dire unfolding humanitarian situation. The time is to save lives and to facilitate solutions to avoid regional escalation. At the tenth GA emergency special session we meet to defend the principles and norms of the UN Charter. We also meet to reaffirm that there is no justification for terrorism anywhere and anytime, nor for loss of lives of any kind. Romania condemns in the strongest possible terms the indiscriminate, atrocious and unprovoked terrorist attacks committed by Hamas across Israel starting with October 7, 2023. Each country has the right to defend itself and its citizens against terrorism, Israel included, in line with international law. We are profoundly shocked by the large amount of lost lives of Israeli and Palestinian alike and our thoughts are with all the innocent victims of the conflict. Romania is one of the countries that mourns the loss of 5 dualnationals. All hostages held by Hamas must be immediately released. We acknowledge the work undertaken by international partners in releasing them. As one of the countries that has one dual national held hostage, we hope the work in releasing them will continue. Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people, but on the contrary, it acts against their aspirations by harming the Palestinian cause and the prospects of the two state-solution. My delegation reiterates the call to make a clear distinction between the justified and legitimate Palestinian expectations and demarches, which should be only addressed as part of a political process, and the terrorist attacks of Hamas, which are harming, in the end, Palestinian lives and future. Mr. President, At this stage of the current conflict, it is important to reaffirm the respect of international law and the universal principles of international humanitarian 3 law, particularly the Geneva conventions. The protection of civilians, especially children, must be ensured at all times by all. While we welcome the humanitarian trucks that crossed Raffah last weekend and in the following days, we should be firm and united in upholding unhindered humanitarian assistance to Gaza. These measures are necessary, including humanitarian pauses, so as to allow the full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access, consistent with international humanitarian law, for United Nations humanitarian agencies and their implementing partners to act swiftly. All civilians should be protected, at all times. As you know, the European Union and its Member States will continue their efforts to assist EU citizens in the region. From a national point of view this also includes their evacuation upon request. The conflict in Gaza not only destroys the future of Israelis and Palestinians, but it also has an immense potential to sparkle hate speech around the world. The rise of antisemitism, an anti-Palestinian or islamophobic speech in Europe is of great concern. It is the moment to act again and speak out against hatred. Taking into consideration all these aspects, and convinced that the most durable solutions to such complex situation are only those emerging and endorsed by all the legitimate parties involved, Romania has abstained at today¡¯s vote on the draft resolution. Mr. President, For too long we have witnessed the lack of meaningful progress of the MEPP, many windows of opportunity have been lost and, in the end, civilians paid the price. However, we cannot give up peace. The two-state solution remains indispensable and the only option available for a lasting resolution the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The two-state solution remains also indispensable for bringing just and lasting peace in the Middle East based on international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions. 4 The two-state solution will prevent the spill-over of the conflict and stop other actors in fueling it. My delegation stands ready to engage for mediation efforts as part of the joint international responsibility to maintain peace and security. Thank you."
Barbados,"Mr President, Barbados associates itself with the statement delivered by Jamaica on behalf of the Caribbean Community during this session as well as the CARICOM statement of 9 October 2023. Barbados condemns the heinous terrorist attacks perpetrated on Israel on October 7th, 2023 which caused over a thousand to lose their lives and hundreds to be taken hostage, including women and children. Those responsible for these devastating violent acts must be brought to account. We express our alarm at the deteriorating situation in the Middle East and our deep concern for the safety and security of the people of Israel and Palestine. The conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza threatens to spill over to the entire Middle East with catastrophic results for the people of that region, for global peace and for the already fragile multilateral order. If the conflict continues unabated it will also have devastating impacts on vulnerable populations everywhere. The international community of sovereign states and their peoples must therefore unite and prevent the situation from any further deterioration. The UN Security Council must act urgently and in unison. In this regard, Barbados welcomes the adoption on Friday 27 October, 2023 by our assembly of a resolution which called for an ¡°immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities.¡± This is an important signal by the global community. Barbados voted in favour of that resolution because of its clear call for the protection of all civilians and the release of hostages, for the respect of international law and for the need to find a lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the basis of a two-state solution. We also supported Canada¡¯s proposed amendment because it clearly identified those responsible for the terrorist attacks of the 7 th of October on Israel. These points are all in accordance with Barbados¡¯ views on the situation as set out in our statement of 24 October 2023. An immediate humanitarian ceasefire, as called for by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, is essential in order to ensure the protection of the lives and wellbeing of the innocent civilians of Israel and Gaza. Any aerial bombardment in Gaza, an area smaller than Barbados, but with seven times our own population, is bound to have devastating effects on civilians. The death of thousands of Palestinians in these last weeks is testimony to this. Barbados further calls for the immediate, unconditional release of all hostages and the provision of humanitarian assistance in all its dimensions to the people of Gaza. I also wish to express Barbados¡¯ support and appreciation for the remarkable work and terrible sacrifices of the UN¡¯s staff on the ground. Barbados commends the Secretary-General and his teams for their efforts to provide relief and find a path to peace. Since joining the United Nations upon our independence in 1966, Barbados has supported a two-state solution, recognising the rights of the people of both Israel and Palestine to their own state. The international community must now urgently agree and take action to ensure that the Palestinian people can exercise their right to self-determination in an independent internationallyrecognised state in accordance with international law. A sustainable peace must be the world¡¯s singular focus and it is only with dialogue that this can be achieved."

I thank you, Mr. President."
Tonga,"Mr. President,
I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Kingdom of Tonga.
Tonga condemns the horrific terrorist attacks by Hamas against the State of Israel
on 7 October 2023 which resulted in the slaughter of civilians. Tonga condemns
further the kidnapping of civilians, during that attack, and who continue to be held
captive as hostages. Tonga stands in solidarity with those who call for their
immediate and unconditional release.
Tonga supports Israel¡¯s inherent right of self defence, as assured by the Charter of
the United Nations, in its determined response to protect its citizens and bring
stability to the volatile security situation. Mr. President,
We acknowledge that this should not lessen the rights of Israelis and Palestinians to
live in safety, in dignity, and in peace. Civilians, be they Israelis or Palestinians, are
not a target and must be protected. Tonga supports further the desperate need for
humanitarian aid to be delivered without restrictions and undue delay. In that regard,
any respite in the military campaign in Gaza will be most helpful in order to facilitate
delivery of such humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians.
Mr. President,
As we continue our prayers for those who mourn the loss of loved ones, those who
have survived and those who are living now in uncertain fear and pain, the Kingdom
of Tonga remains steadfast in its call for a peaceful coexistence between Israelis and
Palestinians.
I thank you."
UAE,"Mr. President,
I would like to begin by aligning the UAE¡¯s voice with the statements delivered on
behalf of the Arab Group, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Gulf
Cooperation Council, and the Non-Aligned Movement.
I welcome the adoption of the General Assembly¡¯s critical resolution last Friday in
response to the bloody war in the Gaza Strip, where civilians are bearing the brunt
of its impacts.
Confronted with scenes of massive devastation, the killing of around 9,000
Palestinians, and the displacement of more than 1.4 million people as a result of the
violent Israeli bombing and the expansion of its ground operation, the overwhelming
majority of the UN member states agreed on the need to adopt this resolution, which
calls for an immediate, sustainable, and durable humanitarian truce.
This resolution sends a clear message about the need to uphold international
humanitarian law and to reject the double standards that are at play regarding the
protection of civilians. We recall here that nearly seventy percent of Palestinians
killed over the past several weeks were women and children. We urge the international community to demonstrate unity, coordination, and
redouble diplomatic efforts to end all hostilities. This is critical to maintain both
regional and international peace and security. The tensions and maneuvers we are
witnessing in southern Lebanon, the occupied Syrian Golan, and the Red Sea risk
expanding this conflict across the wider region. The escalation could also reach a
level that is no longer containable.
The UAE will continue to support ongoing efforts to stop this war ? both through
our efforts in the Security Council as well as in our extensive exchanges with actors
in the region and beyond.
Mr. President,
The position of the UAE has been clear since October 7th. We have affirmed that
Hamas¡¯ attacks against civilians are unacceptable, and we have demanded the
release of all hostages. We have also categorically rejected the Israeli policy of
collective punishment and emphasize the imperative of ensuring full respect for
international humanitarian law, which demands Israel to stop its unrelenting and
indiscriminate bombing of civilians and civilian objects.
Today, there is no place or person who is safe in Gaza. Israel is bombing refugee
camps, schools, hospitals, mosques, churches, and United Nations facilities, where
people are seeking shelter. Several journalists, medical workers and 70 UNRWA
staff have also been killed. We reiterate here our strong condemnation of last
Tuesday Israeli heavy air strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, which resulted in
hundreds of deaths and injuries. Even those who were displaced to the South, despite
the impossible orders of Israel to the people to evacuate from the North, couldn¡¯t
escape the bombing.
As we have stated time and again, the UAE firmly rejects the forced displacement
of the Palestinian people from their land. We will not allow a new Nakba to occur.
We are deeply concerned about the declared siege on the Gaza Strip and the severe
restrictions on water, food and other essential goods, including the complete denial
of electricity, and fuel to the Gaza Strip, leading to the collapse of the healthcare
system. Meanwhile, humanitarian aid is accumulating at the Rafah crossing. Only
a very limited percentage of trucks have entered Gaza, representing less than 4% of
the total volume of commodities that used to enter before the war.  We appreciate Egypt¡¯s continued efforts to ensure access to humanitarian aid in
Gaza, in addition to other critical efforts, including its receipt yesterday of a number
of the injured and sick from the war in Gaza for treatment.
All parties to the conflict, namely Israel, must allow and facilitate rapid, safe, and
unhindered passage of humanitarian aid for all civilians in need throughout
Gaza, in a sustained manner.
The full and unimpeded access of humanitarian personnel must also be ensured. We
also stress the importance of allowing them into and throughout the Gaza Strip to
address the acute humanitarian crisis there.
We further stress that internet and communication networks should continue to
operate without interruption to facilitate the work of medical teams and humanitarian
actors.
Mr. President,
The UAE continues to follow its historic and longstanding approach of supporting
the Palestinian people. Once the war began, we hastened to launch a national
campaign titled ¡°Tarahum - for Gaza¡± and opened a humanitarian air bridge to Egypt
for UAE aid and UN assistance to reach the people of Gaza as quickly as possible.
The UAE also pledged USD 20 million to UNRWA this month, in addition to the
USD 35 million that we provided earlier this year. The UAE President His Highness
Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan also directed the provision of medical
treatment for 1,000 Palestinian children, along with their families, in the UAE.
We also continue to call for the international community to stop managing this
conflict, and to protect and achieve the two-state solution, so that a sovereign
Palestinian state is established on the borders of June 4, 1967, with East Jerusalem
as its capital.
The Palestinian people have suffered for far too long under this occupation and they
deserve, like other peoples, a stable and secure future. A future in which the children
of Gaza can attend schools, not shelter in them, and in which young men and women
build the institutions of their state, and not search for their relatives under the rubble.
Thank you, Mr. President."
Ukraine,"Mr. President, Twenty months ago, a full-fledged war against Ukraine, waged by Russia, has showed how fragile our world is, if the insane dictator equipped with the weapons of mass distraction decides to employ terrorist practices against peaceful sovereign state. The fact that the Assembly had to resume 10th emergency special session is another warning sign that instead of resolving existing conflicts we are dealing with their multiplication. The terrorist groups and terrorist regimes are the only beneficiaries of this menacing developments. Mr. President, We condemn the brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks of Hamas on Israel on October 7th that plunged the Middle East region into hostilities. This barbaric massacre by Hamas led to horrendous toll of casualties in the course of ongoing hostilities, including among the citizens of Ukraine as well as many other countries. I would like to reiterate once again that Ukrainians feel deeply the pain and devastation of war. Russia and Hamas are driven by the same motivation. As Hamas denies the right of Israel to exist, Russia denies the same right of Ukraine and continues its terror and war of aggression against Ukraine and Ukrainians as a nation. We are concerned that Hamas continues to terrorize the region by indiscriminate attacks against civilians as well as uses them as a human shield. They are still keeping over 200 hostages in Gaza, including babies, children, women and the elderly. It¡¯s also clear that all these actions only aggravate the situation in the region. There is a real threat that conflict could spread throughout the entire region. We must increase our common efforts to avoid further escalation. 2 We are convinced that the strong condemnation of Hamas should be an essential part of the General Assembly response on the current situation. Ukraine has always advocated for calling a spade a spade. We regret that the proposed amendment to the draft resolution regarding the condemnation of Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel has not been approved. We also firmly support Israel¡¯s right to defend itself in line with international law and international humanitarian law. We also demand immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. Today, it is critically important to avoid further increase in the number of civilian casualties both in Israel and Palestine. Every life is a value. All civilians must be protected. The international community must take all possible measures to safeguard the innocent civilian lives, including the international and local humanitarian personnel that work on the ground. We urge to strictly abide by the rules of warfare and respect the norms of international humanitarian law. All actions must be taken to save lives and minimize harm to civilians. Ukraine expresses gravest concern for the deterioration of humanitarian situation in Gaza. We emphasize the need of unhindered humanitarian access and aid to protect and help civilians, including through humanitarian corridors. Ukraine is convinced that humanitarian support and access must be maintained into Gaza to enable access to essential aid, water, food and medical care, fuel and shelter to reach all civilians that are suffering. We commend dedicated humanitarian work of the UNRWA staff and all agencies who provide humanitarian support. We express our sincere condolences to families of the humanitarian personnel who have lost their lives since October 7th. Mr. President, Current situation in the region only undermines the prospects of a peaceful future for two peoples. At the same time the Middle East peace process remains the basis of any efforts aimed at restoring regional stability and security. Ukraine has 3 consistently supported the implementation of the principle of two states, Israel and Palestine, that live side by side in peace and security, and advocates the settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict with the help of political and diplomatic means. We are confident that a just, comprehensive and sustainable peace in the Middle East can be realized within the framework of unconditional implementation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions and other international agreements. The General Assembly has demanded to ensure the protection of civilians and civilian objects as well as to enable and facilitate humanitarian access for essential supplies and services to reach all civilians in need; the immediate, continuous, sufficient and unhindered provision of essential goods and services to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip. The Assembly also called for immediate, full, sustained, safe and unhindered humanitarian access for the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and all other humanitarian organizations, upholding humanitarian principles and delivering urgent assistance to civilians in the Gaza Strip, encouraged the establishment of humanitarian corridors and other initiatives to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians, and welcomes efforts in this regard. Ukraine calls for these urgent tasks to be fully implemented. Thank you."
South Sudan,"Mr. President, Your Excellencies, dear colleagues, The Government of South Sudan extends its heartfelt condolences for the tragic loss of innocent lives of children and women from both sides of the conflict, Israel and Palestine we know too well the truth of conflicts and we know that lost during the time of crisis is never easy, and we share in your grief. During times of crisis, it is also imperative that we unite and strive for a peaceful resolution to the matter. The Government of South Sudan firmly believe that peace is the only path forward, and we call upon all the involved parties to earnestly work towards resolving the conflict through peaceful means. The Government of South Sudan unequivocally denounce the use of terrorism as a means to achieve political objectives. South Sudan abstained from the resolution because Terrorism is indefensible, and any resolution must hold those responsible for the events on October 7th accountable. Furthermore, we implore Hamas to release all hostages without preconditions. Children should never be used as pawns; they deserve the opportunity to live their childhood without fear. We also advocate for unrestricted humanitarian aid access and the safeguarding of civilian populations by both sides. Mr. President Your Excellencies, dear colleagues, The core of this matter lies in a clear moral distinction between right and wrong. War inflicts pain and destruction, while peace fosters healing and prosperity. Let us work together in pursuit of a peaceful resolution that benefits all parties involved. Today, we stand before you with heavy hearts, fully aware that this very podium was established to address the crises that may arise similar to the one we face today. While disagreements are inevitable among us as human beings, we believe that in such moments, unprovoked terror cannot be equated with rights and cannot justify any grievances. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been extensively documented in various UN resolutions and negotiated agreements. Therefore, a final agreement must be the result of negotiations between the concerned parties. While external support can facilitate peace, the primary commitment must come from the parties themselves. We draw inspiration from South Sudan's long struggle for self-determination, which eventually led to our independence in 2011. It demonstrates that even after years of conflict, negotiations accepted by both parties can pave the way for a peaceful settlement. Once again, we emphasise that the core issue here is a clear moral distinction between right and wrong. Terrorism is unacceptable, and any resolution must ensure accountability for the events of October 7th. Mr. President, South Sudan urgently call for the release of all hostages by Hamas without preconditions. Children should not be used as bargaining chips; they deserve the opportunity to enjoy their childhood. Additionally, we advocate for unhindered access to humanitarian aid and the protection of civilian populations by all involved parties. The path to a win-win situation lies in embracing peace, as war only brings destruction and suffering. South Sudan remains optimistic about the future of the world. We have come a long way since our struggle for independence, overcoming numerous challenges and gaining valuable experiences. With continued international coordination, we are confident that we can realise our vision of a peaceful, prosperous, and progressive world. Our historical struggle for self-determination stands as a testament to the power of dialogue, understanding, and cooperation in shaping a better world. Mr. President, We are committed to contributing to global efforts to address the challenges facing our human family. We pledge our dedication to multilateralism and international cooperation as the most effective means to achieve our shared aspirations. We are eager to actively engage in this assembly and other forums to exchange insights, experiences, and best practices with fellow member states. Together, we can rebuild trust and rekindle global solidarity, ensuring a brighter future for current and future generations. In these trying times, when the world faces terror, unprovoked attacks and crisis, it falls upon those unafraid to condemn to pave the way that leads to peace. President Salva Kiir Mayardit extends his condolences to the lost of innocent children, women and population. His Excellency has condemns the heinous and unprovoked terror perpetrated by Hamas, emphasising that no political grievances can ever justify the killing of innocent civilians. Mr. President, This message conveys South Sudan's solidarity with the innocents in the face of conflict and its resolute condemnation of violence targeting innocent people. South Sudan stands firmly with the international community in denouncing all forms of terrorism and violence against civilians. South Sudan stands for peace and we call for peace. I thank you for your kind attention."
Norway,"President, For the sake of children, Palestinian children, and Israeli children, the world must do better. Diplomacy must do better. Save the Children reported Sunday that nearly 3,200 children were killed in Gaza in just three weeks. 1,000 more are missing, presumed dead. On the Israeli side, at least 30 children have been killed. Every child¡¯s death is one too many. Children bear no responsibility for the situation and must be protected. We grieve with Israeli and Palestinian parents, and can only imagine the desperation and sorrow caused by the loss of their loved ones. People on both sides deserve to live in peace and security. Two issues need to be crystal clear: 1) All parties must act in accordance with international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians caught in the midst of hostilities. Even wars have rules. 2) All lives are equal and there is no hierarchy between them. This is essential, not only for the protection of civilians today, but for the future for both Israelis and Palestinians. How people are treated during the conflict can determine the prospects for a political solution that can lead to durable peace. President, We meet at an extremely critical time. For Israelis and Palestinians, for the Middle East and the world. Norway has strongly condemned Hamas¡¯ heinous terrorist attacks on 7 October, killing about 1400 people and taking more than 200 hostages. We demand that Hamas and other actors in Gaza release all hostages immediately and unconditionally. Israel has a right to defend itself against the armed attacks by Hamas. However, we emphasize that the self-defense measures taken must be necessary and proportionate. Furthermore, all military operations must be conducted in line with international humanitarian law. All parties to armed conflicts have an obligation to protect civilians and civilian objects, including hospitals, schools, and other civilian infrastructure. The scale of the civilian suffering, both physically and mentally, inflicted by the combination of intense Israeli bombardments and a blockade is heartbreaking and unacceptable. President, On the basis of this humanitarian catastrophe, we find it difficult to draw any other conclusion than that the parties to this conflict are not doing enough to comply with their obligations to protect the civilians affected by the ongoing hostilities. We call on all actors to strictly adhere to the international humanitarian law principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack. We also call on the parties to ensure safe, rapid and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance and essential services for all civilians in need in the Gaza Strip. All parties to the conflict must make sure that the civilian population can uphold the bare necessities of life, even in the midst of war. Opening the Karem Shalom border crossing would also improve humanitarian access while safeguarding Israel¡¯s legitimate security concerns. On the Egyptian side, we encourage accepting the offer of international humanitarian staff to complement and boost the impressive work of the Egyptian Red Crescent. We commend the courage and resilience of Palestinian health and humanitarian workers, volunteers for their heroic efforts to save lives, while risking their own. We mourn with the families of those who tragically lost their lives in their pursuit for humanity, peace, and a better world for others. We must honor their memory by giving it our best. Diplomacy must do better. President, We are deeply concerned about the increase in violence in the West Bank, including from Israeli settlers. The consequences of a further escalation of violence and potential destabilization in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the broader Middle East region would be devastating. Norway is closely following the violence on the border between Lebanon and Israel. We call on all actors in the region to contribute to de-escalation to prevent a (wider) regional conflict. The UN¡¯s role is indispensable in this crisis. The UN family on the ground is making tremendous efforts to deliver on the humanitarian needs of Gaza¡¯s population, under impossible circumstances. UNWRA, despite years of underfinancing, is making an absolutely crucial contribution. We encourage all member states to respond to appeals for additional financial support, to ensure that the UN can maintain and scale up its response. President, We regret the Security Council¡¯s inability to come together to recommend actions to de-escalate and alleviate the grave humanitarian situation. The veto should never prevent the UN from having a voice to fulfill its mandate. It is therefore vital that the General Assembly has taken up its responsibility, adopting a resolution calling for a durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities. Norway voted in favor of this resolution, in light of the gravity of the situation on the ground, in particular regarding the humanitarian catastrophe we see evolving in Gaza. The violence must stop. [We hope the Council will take up its responsibility. On 25 October, as Chair of the AHLC, Norway hosted an informal meeting among international partners in the international donor group for Palestine. There was broad agreement among participants about the urgency of providing humanitarian assistance and ensuring access to Gaza. The need to continue our support to the Palestinian Authority, its institutions and service delivery to the Palestinian people was another clear call from the meeting. Regardless of the outcome of the ongoing war, there is no military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The solution can only be political. There must be a credible political path. The only viable solution to achieve lasting peace, security, and self-determination for both peoples, is a negotiated twostate solution. Even in the middle of a war there is a need to discuss ways to build a credible path towards peace. The children in Palestine and Israel are paying the highest price. They are being traumatized by this war for life. These children will one day be the leaders that we all depend on for a peaceful Middle East. President, I reiterate one last message; diplomacy must do better."
Tanzania,"Mr. President,
I thank you for availing us this opportunity to address the Assembly on the
agenda item at hand. The United Republic of Tanzania wishes to register its
concerns pertaining to the situation currently unfolding in the Middle East,
particularly the conflict between Israel and Palestine. This conflict has once
more exposed the faultlines of our esteemed Organization, the United Nations,
whereby a body entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining international
peace and security has thus far failed to stop a deeply rooted conflict, which is
having dire ramifications on the civilian populations in Gaza and Israel. The
paralysis of the United Nations Security Council to act on this matter is not a
new phenomenon. Addressing this august chamber in 1967, Tanzania warned,
and I wish to reiterate that warning for record that, ¡°the effective survival of the
United Nations as an instrument for world peace is seriously endangered by its
inability to stop conflicts and aggression in the world and in the Middle East in
particular.¡±
2
This inability, which is chronic when it comes to the question of Palestine, has
necessitated this emergency session. Tanzania joined 120 member states in
voting for a resolution which calls for immediate ceasefire to allow for
humanitarian assistance to those that badly needs it. We participated in the
vote, while being fully aware that, it would take more than the voices of this
august chamber to achieve this objective. We know it up to Israel and Palestine
to put a stop to the deadly conflict, which has the potential of turning into our
worst nightmare. Peace, which is the ultimate desire of the United Nations has
and remains elusive. Instead of sowing peace in the region, we have witnessed
the sowing of violence, hatred and vengeance. If the old proverb, ¡°you reap
what you sow¡± is anything to go by, we should not be surprised to witness the
continuance of the conflict and violence between Israel and Palestine. We must
opt for peace, if we seek to achieve lasting peace in the region and the world.
That said Mr. President, Tanzania strongly denounces all forms of violence by
whomsoever committed. We recognize that conflict and violence have never
been viable tools for achieving peace. If anything, an eye for an eye would leave
all concerned blind. We thus implore upon all concerned to exercise restraint,
to allay further suffering. Tanzania recognizes that Israel has the right to live in
peace and security, but the same applies to its neighbours, including Palestine.
Violence is the wrong way, peace the best way. As such we implore all parties
concerned to seek a path towards lasting peace through genuine dialogue,
underpinned by the support of the international community. Despite the thick
clouds and blinding mist, there is hope to achieve the long-desired goal of the
establishment of two equally viable States, coexisting in peace, harmony and
prosperity. Let¡¯s work towards peace, it can be done, let each one of us do their
part.
I thank you. "
